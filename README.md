#Pose Optimization Using G2O Library: an Easy Example

##A small sample for pose optimization using g2o to minimize reprojection errors.

### Usage:

Requirement:

1. OpenCV 3.1.0 or newer version.

2. LAPACK && Suitesparse && Eigen3.

Example:

There is an example given on optimizing a pose calculated from EPnP to give intuitions on the performance of g2o. 

You may write extra code to implement other optimization based on g2o.
